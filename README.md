## Background

Jin Hyung Lee is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics at George Mason University, expected to graduate in December 2025. He is advised by [Dr. Ben Seiyon Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/benslee/). His dissertation focuses on Variational Inference, Bayesian statistics, Deep learning, and Spatial statistics. During Summer 2023 and Summer 2024, Jin completed biostatistician internships at [Astellas Pharma US](https://www.astellas.com/us/), where he applied Bayesian statistical methods to enhance the efficiency and rigor of the clinical trial process.

Prior to joining George Mason, Jin served as a Senior Researcher at the [Korea International Trade Association](https://www.kita.org/). During that appointment, he earned an M.S. in Biostatistics from the School of Public Health at [Seoul National University](https://health.snu.ac.kr/en/), under the supervision of [Dr. Ho Kim](https://health.snu.ac.kr/en/snu__professor/%EA%B9%80%ED%98%B8/). He holds a B.A. in Applied Statistics and Economics from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp).
