## Background

Jin Hyung Lee is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics at George Mason University, expected to graduate in December 2025. He is advised by [Dr. Ben Seiyon Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/benslee/). His dissertation focuses on variational inference, Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and spatial statistics. During Summer 2023 and Summer 2024, During the summers of 2023 and 2024, Jin completed biostatistician internships at [Astellas Pharma US](https://www.astellas.com/us/), where he applied Bayesian statistical methods to enhance the efficiency and rigor of the clinical trial process.
Prior to joining George Mason, Jin served as a Senior Researcher at the [Korea International Trade Association](https://www.kita.org/). During that appointment, he earned an M.S. in Biostatistics from the School of Public Health at [Seoul National University](https://health.snu.ac.kr/en/), under the supervision of [Dr. Ho Kim](https://health.snu.ac.kr/en/snu__professor/%EA%B9%80%ED%98%B8/). He holds a B.A. in Applied Statistics and Economics from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp).
